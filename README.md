It is a relic from a different timeâ€”2008, in fact. By today's standards, it is horribly ugly and non-functional. If you try to use this on a smartphone it will probably explode or something. This code, in its extraordinarily limited usefulness, is now dedicated to the public domain; where this is not applicable, it is available under the terms of the Unlicense (see LICENSE).

## Yellow Navigation

*Yellow Navigation* is a side navigation bar for HTML 4.01 that emulates the appearance of traditional frameset navigation using CSS 2.1 while preserving browser history functionality. It targets Firefox 3.0 and Internet Explorer 7 but should work on other browsers which support CSS.
